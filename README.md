# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It was produced as a part of the Lighthouse Labs Week 3 activities in the Web Development Full-Time Bootcamp. The app not only keeps track of shortened URLs in a handy index, but also allows users to delete their URLS, edit the redirecting URL, and track analytics for use of the shortened URLs.
